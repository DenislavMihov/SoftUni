Exercise: Functions

1. Smallest of Three Numbers

Write a function that receives three integer numbers and returns the smallest. Print the result on the console. Use an appropriate name for the function.

2. Add and Subtract

You will receive three integer numbers.

Write functions named:

· sum_numbers() that returns the sum of the first two integers

· subtract() that returns the difference between the returned result of the first function and the third integer

Wrap the two functions in a function named add_and_subtract() which will receive the three numbers as parameters. Print the result of the subtract() function on the console.

3. Characters in Range

Write a function that receives two characters and returns a single string with all the characters in between them (according to the ASCII code), separated by a single space. Print the result on the console.

4. Odd and Even Sum

You will receive a single number. You should write a function that returns the sum of all even and all odd digits in a given number. The result should be returned as a single string in the format:

"Odd sum = {sum_of_odd_digits}, Even sum = {sum_of_even_digits}"

Print the result of the function on the console

5. Even Numbers

Write a program that receives a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space. It should print a list of only the even numbers. Use filter()

6. Sort

Write a program that receives a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space. It should print a sorted list of numbers in ascending order. Use sorted().

7. Min Max and Sum

Write a program that receives a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space. It should print the min and max values of the given numbers and the sum of all the numbers in the list. Use min(), max() and sum().

The output should be as follows:

· On the first line: "The minimum number is {minimum number}"

· On the second line: "The maximum number is {maximum number}"

· On the third line: "The sum number is: {sum of all numbers}"


8. Palindrome Integers

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a function that receives a list of positive integers, separated by comma and space ", ". The function should check if each integer is a palindrome - True or False. Print the result.
