1.Absolute Values

Write a program that receives a sequence of numbers, separated by a single space, and prints their absolute value as a list. Use abs().

2. Grades

· 2.00 – 2.99 - "Fail"

· 3.00 – 3.49 - "Poor"

· 3.50 – 4.49 - "Good"

· 4.50 – 5.49 - "Very Good"

3. Calculations

Create a function that receives three parameters, calculates a result depending on the given operator, and returns it. Print the result of the function.

The input comes as three parameters – an operator as a string and two integer numbers. The operator can be one of the following: "multiply", "divide", "add", "subtract".

4. Repeat String

Write a function that receives a string and a counter n. The function should return a new string – the result of repeating the old string n times. Print the result of the function. Try using lambda.
